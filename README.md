Let's break down the steps to set up your "Personal Finance Tracker with API Integration" project using Django, following the structure you've provided. We'll take it one step at a time.

Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment
Create the Django Project and App: First, let's set up the project structure you provided.

bash
Copy code
django-admin startproject finance_tracker
cd finance_tracker
python manage.py startapp core
Install Required Packages: Create and activate a virtual environment for your project (if you haven't already done so):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Django, Django REST Framework, and other dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install django djangorestframework requests plaid-python python-dotenv
requests: For API calls (to Plaid, Google, and currency APIs).
plaid-python: For integration with the Plaid API.
python-dotenv: For loading sensitive data (like API keys) from a .env file.
Set Up Your Project Folder Structure: You already have the folder structure in mind. Here's a brief overview:

bash
Copy code
finance_tracker/
├── finance_tracker/         # Django project folder
│   ├── settings.py          # Project settings
│   ├── urls.py              # Project URL routing
│   ├── wsgi.py              # WSGI server entry
├── core/                    # Django app folder
│   ├── models.py            # Database models
│   ├── views.py             # Views for your app
│   ├── urls.py              # URLs for the core app
│   ├── templates/           # HTML templates
│   └── static/              # Static files (CSS, JS, images)
├── manage.py                # Django management script
└── .env                     # To store sensitive data like API keys
This structure aligns with your intended setup and will allow for easy management of the frontend (templates, static files) and backend (models, views, API integration).
